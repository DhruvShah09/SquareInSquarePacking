# SquareInSquarePacking
Toy project that helps practice with Computational and Spatial Geometry Applications, to use, simply run the notebook. Some helpful tips: 
- To manipulate a polygon within the board, simply index it in the polygon backing array and use one of the update methods (i.e., rotate, se2, translate) 
- The Square class contains helpful methods for manipulating the square
- Refitting the board gives you the minimal bounding square
- There exists an animator object if you wish to see your algorithm in action, to use it, simply keep track of the square space, bounding origin, and the minimal bounding square side length, after which an animation can be created using BoardAnimation.animate with the appropriate parameters set after the initialization of the BoardAnimation object. 
- This is a toy project and may or may not be updated with implementations of packing algorithms.
